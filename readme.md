# Concert tracker
I chose to do a concert tracking app where users can log all the concerts they've seen and keep them in once place. As a fan of seeing live music, I created this app partially for myself to keep track of all the concerts I've seen in one place.

## Attributions
 ### Class notes and labs
-  Class notes and labs - I used the [Cookbook lab](https://github.com/michaelmcbride113/men-stack-relating-data-lab-cookbook) and Skyrockit in class lesson as a baseline for my project.

## Technologies Used: 
1. **EJS**
    * EJS was used to write all the text on the website
    * EJS files were used for the majority of the content on my site and were pivotal
2. **CSS**
    * CSS was used for styling the site
    * Before implementing the CSS, my website was not ugly to look at and not easy to use
3. **Javascript**
    * Javascript was used for my auth and concerts controllers which are where the majoity of my routes are housed
    * Javascript was also used for creating my user schema and building custom middleware for my site
4. **server.js**
    * Is used for housing my initial route and housing the background logic that allows my site to run 


## Next steps
There were quite a few things I wanted to include in my site but I was unable to due to time limitations and my current skill level 

1. **Add in social components to the site**
* Currently my site only allows users to view their own concerts. In the future I'd like to allow users to view other users concert pages and like their posts

2. **Add photos to concert pages**
* Originally I had planned on building an area for users to add photos/videos from the concerts they went to. When I update this in the future, I'd like to add this functionality in

3. **Sort by artist/date**
* Currently users are only able to view all the concerts they've attended on one page without the ability to sort. In the future, I'd like to allow users to sort their concerts by band and date
